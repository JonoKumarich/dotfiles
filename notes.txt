TODO: 
- Add custom functions to git (e..g vim.fish in fish/functions/vim.fish)
- Add a nvim color scheme (the one in second video seems good) (make sure to set lazy loading off)
- Map comment key (gcc) to something better)
- Stop comments auto spreading to next line when pressing enter
- RRethy/vim-illuminate for highlighting current key word in rest of file

Packages:
- Note taking plugin: https://github.com/renerocksai/telekasten.nvim

Things to remember:

Telescope:
 - ff: File finder
 - fg: text searched (grep)
 - fk: Shows all keymaps
 - fb: Shows file buffer

Indenting:
 - > or < (once in visual, twice in normal)

Commenting:
 - gcc : Would like to map this to something better in the future

Treesitter:
- This is the syntax highlighting plugin. Need to add new languages manually in plugin file
